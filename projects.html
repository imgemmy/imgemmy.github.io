      <h2>irOverlay Electron.js</h2>
      <p>
        To get familiar with Electron I ported some of the web app functionality from irOverlay to a desktop app.
        <br>
        <br>
        This was a fun & simple project to get started with the framework.
        <br>
        <br>
        Most of the code was reused from the web app, with some minor changes to make it work with Electron.
